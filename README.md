# soap-webservices-tutorial : my practice work to understand the nitty gritty details of soap webservices creating and testing using javax.xml and also deploying to glassfish and working on eclipse keepler and finally using wsimport to create and wsdl file and also creting seperate src and class files package from wsdl file that got served from glassfish running. and several things that i learned.

I have created this project to test soap webservices using java libraries such SAAJ stands for SOAP with attachments API for JAVA, testNG, java.xml.xpath and few others. And this is a POM project.
